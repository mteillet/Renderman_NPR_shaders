# OSL shader

OSL is Open Shading Language
Originally developped by Sony Pictures
Need to be compiled before use - either through command line with UNIX / from renderman PxrOSL node directly in the hypershade
Can be used with a wide variety of applications/platforms
Faster the SeExpression
Slower than C++

Small language but very effective to describe material, lights, displacement, and pattern generation

Syntax similar to the C language
